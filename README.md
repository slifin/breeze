## Concept

Breeze is a series of alternative constructs for your code to decrease [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity). 

To decrease cyclomatic complexity avoid nameless conditionals/functions and code blocks,
Since these are the foundations of modern code, this document contains context dependent alternatives.

## If
```php
if () {}
```
The if statement is a short hand [language construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_construct), it is comprised of:
  * A conditional that can be nameless
  * A code block that is nameless and imports all parent scope
  
### Setting Defaults

## Foreach
```php
foreach () {}
```
