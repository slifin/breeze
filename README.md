## About

üçÉBreeze is a series of alternative constructs for your code to decrease [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity). 

Cyclomatic complexity is often used as a software measurement by [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/), [Scruitinzer](scrutinizer-ci.com) and other code review tools.

To decrease cyclomatic complexity avoid nameless conditionals/functions and code blocks,
Since these are the foundations of modern code, üçÉBreeze contains context dependent alternatives.

## If
```php
if () {}
```
The if statement is a short hand [language construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_construct), it is comprised of:
  * A conditional that can be nameless
  * A code block that is nameless and imports the parent scope
  
### Setting Defaults

## Foreach
```php
foreach () {}
```
