## About

Breeze is a series of alternative constructs for your code to decrease [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity). 

#### üî¨ Code Review

Cyclomatic complexity is often used as a software measurement by [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/), [Scruitinzer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com) and other code review tools.

To decrease cyclomatic complexity avoid nameless conditionals/functions and code blocks, Breeze contains context dependent alternatives.

## If
```php
if () {}
```
The if statement is a short hand [language construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_construct), it is comprised of:
  * A conditional that can be nameless
  * A code block that is nameless and imports the parent scope
  
### Setting Defaults
```php
if (isset($myVariable)) {
  $myVariable = 5;
}
```

```php
$issetMyVariable = isset($myVariable);
$defaultMyVariable = 5;
$myVariable = $issetMyVariable ? $myVariable : $defaultMyVariable; 
```
```php
$myVariable = $myVariable ?? 5;
```
## Foreach
```php
foreach () {}
```
