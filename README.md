* Concept
* [If Statement](#if)
  * Setting defaults
  * Variable set to one or the other based on condition
  * Run a code block based on condition
  * Run a code block based on condition with return
* [Foreach Statement](#foreach)

## Concept
Breeze is a series of alternative constructs for your code to decrease [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity). 

To decrease cyclomatic complexity avoid nameless conditionals/functions and code blocks,
Since these are the foundations of modern code, this document contains context dependent alternatives.

## if
```php
if () {}
```
The if statement is a short hand language construct, it is comprised of:
  * A conditional that can be nameless
  * A code block that is nameless and imports all parent scope

## foreach
